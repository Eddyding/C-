// a  programmer is a machine for turning caffeine into code.

note that a declaration is a statement and that an expression 
becomes a statement when you add a semicolon at its end.

Unlike an expression, a statement does not have a value.

Instead,statements are used to specify the order of execution.

a = b+c;// expression statement
if(a == 7)// if-statement
	b =  9;//execute if and only if a == 7

Logically, a = b+c is executed before the if,as everyone would expect.

A compiler may reorder code to improve performance as long as the 
result is identical to that of the simple order of execution.
