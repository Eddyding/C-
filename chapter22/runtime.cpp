run-time type information:RTTI

casting from  a base  class  to a derived class is  often called  a downcast  because of
the convention of drawing inheritance trees growing from the root down.
a cast from a a derived class to a base  is called an upcast.

a cast that  goes  from  a base to  a sibling  class, like the cast from  
, is called a crosscast.

the dynamic_cast operator takes two operands. a type bracketed by < and >.
and a pointer  or reference bracketed by (and ).
sublattice

also,a virtual  function  must be  a  member  function.
