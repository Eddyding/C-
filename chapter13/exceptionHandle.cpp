The discussion of errors focuses on errors that  cannot be handled locally 
(within a single small function).

a handler is called stack unwinding

an empty exception specification throw() is defined to be equivalent to noexcept.


Having caught an exception,it is common for a handler to decide that is can't 
completely handle the error.In that case,the handler typically does what can
be done locally and then throws the exception again.

one of the most useful aspects of vector  is that we can  change its size
to suit our needs. The most popular functions for changing size are v.push_back(x),
which adds an x at the end of v.
and v.resize(s),which makes s the number of elements in v.
