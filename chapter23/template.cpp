/*

template<typename C>
you may prefer the shorter and equivalent from template<class C>


The process of generating  a class or a function from a template plus 
a template argument list is  often called  template instantiation.

"C" is a strongly  typed. weakly checked  language.


that point is called  the first point of instantiation


trait.

as for an "ordinary class" we can define  types as members.as usual,
such a type can be  a  class or an  enumeraion.

a class  or a class template can have members that are themselves templates.
